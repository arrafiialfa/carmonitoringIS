## About the Company

A nickel mining company is located in several regions, with one headquarters, one branch office, and six mines in different locations. The company has many vehicles, including passenger and cargo transport vehicles. In addition to company-owned vehicles, there are also vehicles rented from a leasing company.

The company needs an application to monitor the vehicles it owns. This includes monitoring fuel consumption, service schedules, and vehicle usage history. To use a vehicle, employees are required to make a reservation in advance with the vehicle management department or pool, and the vehicle usage must be known or approved by their respective supervisors.
